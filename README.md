# Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer (malignant or benign) using a neural network model. The dataset contains various features extracted from cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features for each sample:
- **Diagnosis**: 1 for malignant (M), 0 for benign (B)
- Various mean, SE (standard error), and worst values for features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `README.md`: Project summary and instructions.
